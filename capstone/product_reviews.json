Some customers love the product's texture, scent, and hydrating properties, stating it leaves their skin feeling soft and smooth. They particularly praise its effectiveness in combating dryness and age-related concerns. However, others express disappointment with the recent formula change, finding it leaves a greasy film, absorbs poorly, and lacks the previous moisturizing benefits. Some even find the scent overpowering compared to the original. \n\n\n",
