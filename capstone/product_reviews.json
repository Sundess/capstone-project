Some customers love the product's texture, scent, and hydrating properties, stating it leaves their skin feeling soft and smooth. They particularly praise its effectiveness in combating dryness and age-related concerns. However, others express disappointment with the recent formula change, finding it leaves a greasy film, absorbs poorly, and lacks the previous moisturizing benefits. Some even find the scent overpowering compared to the original. \n\n\n",

Your skin just feels slimy to the touch, slippery. And the scent is way stronger. Please, OLAY, give us our old formula back!! I'll be purchasing something else.",

Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream feels like exactly what my 53 year old skin needs.It soothes and diminishes dryness and fine lines without irritation or clogging my pores. I love the way it feels on my skin. It is great under makeup and eases that dryness that I feel from both winter and from too much sun. Great for all seasons.

I have suffered from skin redness/blotchiness and dry/combination skin for the past 10 years. I used this particular regenerist product as a recommendation from a .org website for special skin problems. Within 2 weeks my uneven skin tone has leveled, and I am asked all the time if I am wearing foundation- which I don't! I have paid 4x as much for products that didn't work. I hope they never stop making something that I finally found after a 20 year search!",

It made my face feel and look years younger. my skin was very smooth and I can even say I was glowing not literally but it made me feel a lot better about my appearance. That alone is worth the money. The product is very pricey but if you can scrap together the money it will help your over all appearance and make you feel good and smooth skin. To every one the best of luck to all that try this product out. It worked for me and it will work for you. hope this helps any one that wants to try this product out.

Then I got out the magnifying mirror and noticed that a lot of those other little creases and lines seemed shallower than before. Hate to say this, but once again, Mom was right.

You don't need to spend a lot of hard work to just apply, it works while I sleep and under make up. I felt price is reasonable and works great! I have tried more expensive cream for my face and was DISAPOINTED, untill I tried the Olay products I really love them. I also know they work!! I would recommend this products to all skin types, they have several products for every type of skin. Thank You So Very Much. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

It's a bit thicker than some products, so it will take longer to absorb fully. The package technology is actually really cool. You push the whole top of the jar down, and a little bit of the cream comes up. It works something like a push-pop. You get just the right amount, and when you get to the last of it, all of the cream is pushed out so that there isn't any wasted being stuck inside the jar. Love that.",

I use retinol (that is one of the reasons my skin gets dry) but use this cream every other night. For me, it works well as a night cream. I take a warm shower after exercise, rinse with cold to close the pores, and this cream is still absorbed. I like the ingredients. I have seen articles that reccomend some of the ingredients, which were written by dermatologists, and the price is more reasonable than department store brands who sell less product for more money and may not, in some cases, be in touch with the science of skin. I recommend it to younger and older friends because it works! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

The movie is directed by Robert Schwentke, who previously directed The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan. The plot of the movie Frank (Bruce Willis is retired, bored and lonely living off his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house. The only joy in Frank's life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah Mary-Louis Parker). Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces Frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into Franks past and the people he used to work with. Like Frank they are all RED ... Retired Extremely Dangerous. I enjoyed this movie and I think you will too. Thank you for reading my review",

For years, literally years, I searched high and low and low for a product that would tame my mane. I finally found the Exxte Gel and it was like the hair gods smiled on me. Perfect is an understatement. It kept my normally super frizzy, over-the-top-puffy hair tame, smooth, shinny, and appropriately volumized. Additionally, I could get two or three days worth of style put of one application which was AMAZING because before the Exxtra Gel, I'd spend a crazy amount of time wrestling my hair into a tight bun. BUT that was before the formula change. WHAT HAPPENED. Now the gel feels more alcohol or water based. I have to use three times as much. It flakes. I have to rinse it out everyday. It smells weird. It leaves weird dry, frizzy patches. In no way are blow dryers welcome with this new formula. I don't know why Nexxus ruined a wonderful thing that didn't need to be fixed. PLEASE BRING BACK THE LAST FORMULA. P.S. The new branding is beautiful. The sort of rose gold color is really nice....but the formula has to be reverted.",

The old formula was the only gel that worked for me and I've been recommending it to people for years. I don't think I'll be buying this again, and it makes me sad. I feel like I'm breaking up with someone! My hair does not look the way it did with the old formula and the smell alone is enough to keep me away. I seriously might cry... Exxtra gel was like a hair miracle. I could apply it to my slept on, unruly, frizzy head of curls and it made my curls look fresh again. My husband literally has commented on the before and after of the old formula, amazed at how shiny and defined my crazy bed head looked after just a dime sized amount. I had to apply a lot more of the new formula, as it is much less concentrated, to get my hair to look acceptable. Why, why, why I see from other reviews that I am not the only unhappy customer...Please bring back the old formula.",

After I brought home 4 of the product tubes and applied it on my hair, I was upset of the fragrance . It was too late to correct the problem as I was preparing to go to work. My frustration grew when I noticed the inferior product performance on one of my visits to the restroom. This was a cost reduction gone bad and it was also a detrimental impact to the Nexxus brand. Please bring back the previous formula, also bring back the larger ounce packaging as well. Ex-loyal customer of 20+ years",

I have tried tons of professional gels over the years and never found one that kept my curls nice and controlled fritz the way the OLD NEXXUS FORMULA did. The new formula is HORRIBLE!!! My hair is lifeless, frizzy and dull. I have also noticed my scalp itches quite a bit which I have never experienced before, but am unsure if the new formula could be causing it or not. PLEASE! Go back to the old formula! You had a great product for thick, curly hair! Most gels out there are so watery and are not compatible with that hair type. So many companies cater to normal or fine hair types, it is ridiculous. After reading so many of the reviews I am hoping you honor your loyal customers requests and go back to the old formula! If you want to change anything on the old formula you could change the scent... it smells more masculine. A more sweet, fresh scent would be nice.... but using the old formula!",

I was an instant fan and became a loyal customer of this and some of the other Nexxus products. I would brag about Nexxus anytime a stylist asked me to try something different. Unfortunately I'm no longer a fan after having bought two bottles of the newly formulated Nexxus Exxtra Gel. The new formula is now the worst gel I have ever used and I'm upset that the new prettier packaging didn't bother to advertise they changed the formula. I bought the first bottle and thought someone must have tampered with it because it smelled like baby oil. when I bought the second bottle I realized that the formula really had been changed to one that seemed watered down and cheap. It has turned me away from the Nexxus product line I once bragged about and my stylists are happy that I'm buying different brands from them again.",

I used it only 6 or 7 times, but noticed it was drying my hair out, it didn't work at all and I could smell that horrible stench ALL the time! I emptied out the container that I put the gel into, but I can't get the smell out of my container, even after soaking it for two days in Dawn dish soap. If I can't get the smell out, I'll have to throw it away. I'm out a nice chunk of money and I'm VERY unhappy about the change. Sad, another product ruined.",

Much to my surprise I found that they had changed the formula. I gave it a try and immediately notice that this was definitely not the same, nor was as good. First was the fragrance, the old had little to no smell to it, but this new one had too strong a smell. I don't want my hair product to have a scent, that is what cologne is for. My wife immediately commented to me that the scent bothered her. The next issue is that the feel, hold and and styling was not as good as before. It make my hair my hair feel soft after, but so did the original. Bottom line is I don't think this is as good a product as the original. Please bring the original formula back and soon. I loved the old product much better!",

I can't believe that the brand allowed someone in R/D to change the performance of this to such poor performance. Someone didn't do their homework/ testing. I'm not sure why anyone would pay the high price for this premium brand to get Walmart product performance. Disappointing in what has been done as you can read from all the other posts..

Dear Nexxus: I have used your Exxtra Gel, Superior Hold for several years, sold in the tan colored tube. Within the last 6 months or so, the packaging has changed to the copper colored tube, and the gel is different as well. It is less thick and does not hold as well. I was in a store recently and managed to find the older version. It reaffirms my contention that this new formula is not as effective as the old one. Please bring it back!!!

I hope you do bring back the prior formula, I haven't found a replacement, and one never knows what is missed until it isn't around anymore.

I saw Nexus responding in posts last month that an improved/restored formulation will be offered shortly. I really hope this comes to fruition. Although no competitor products I have recently tried come close to measuring up to the original formula, several are indeed superior to your new offering and will unfortunately become my go-to once my current supply of old Exxtra Gel is gone.",

I'm using it only because it is time consuming and expensive to find a replacement. Would much prefer the old formula be reintroduced.",

Consider the fact that just as many men use your gel as women do, besides you don't need to add fragrance to styling gel. Men use cologne and women perfume.

I was relieved to see Nexxus had released Exxtra gel in a shiny new package, and I promptly bought a few bottles online. My happiness changed forever when I realized that more than just the packaging had changed. Where had my beloved Exxtra gel gone The new formula does nothing for my frizz and curls, and to make matters worse the new scent is so overpowering! Nexxus should have specified on the packaging new formula when this was re-released...It is not the same gel, yet it boasts the same name. I will never buy this product again. I am now saving the rest of my tan Exxtra gel bottles for special occasions, and I'm now on the search for a new gel product all together. Such a shame.",

I like the fact that it was a bit thicker and the scent is great, but the performance is far from the standard that the original Nexxus gel had set many years ago. The New Formula doesn't hold like it used to. After 2 hours my hair started losing its shape and style. The worst part of the New Formula is it flakes! I always love Nexxus gel for its ability to keep its shape through out the day and flake free! I remember days when I used to slept with Nexxus gel in my hair and woke up the next day, impress with how it still retain the shape of my hair without any flakes. I am writing this review to show how disappointed I am with the New Formula. I don't see myself ever using this product again at this rate.",

My hair is thick and naturally curly. I deal with a fair amount of frizz, a daily ordeal and nothing has helped like.Nexxus Gel. Now, I put your gel in my hair and as my hair dries it starts to feel like glue. Once my hair is dry, along with the feel of glue my hair feels like straw. I can't run my hand through my hair. I used to be able to get up the day after I washed my hair and add more gel to control any frizz. Now with the new gel when I try to put more gel in my hair, my hair feels like a stiff gluey mess. Stiff as straw and impossible to comb, even with a wide tooth comb. There's no shine, totally dull and lifeless. I was mortified some one might try to touch my hair. Really gross. I washed it out of my hair and never used it again. I've got half a tube and a full tube sitting in my closet, not being used! Please bring back your old gel! PLEASE!!!! Thank you",

Nexus Exxtra gel has been my/the ONLY gel that I have used or would use in more than 30 years...though the packaging has changed over the past 30+ years, the formula has ALWAYS remained true until now. Beleive me, it was perfect and you really should go back!!! The ORIGINAL formula was a great consistency to apply, superior hold, no flaking when combed out and absolutely no heavy build up....even after several days of use....NONE! My hair has always been important to me and my one TRIED and TRUE gel has changed. PLEASE change back.... When something is perfect, you don't change....read the hundreds and soon to be thousands of other reviews on this change.... Everyone hates the new stuff. I'm a 30 year veteran of your original product and hate the new stuff....you know it's not the same as soon as you apply it in your hands!",

The scent is nice, its not overpowering. I also noticed that my hair moves a bit more its not really stiff like the old formula. I like it and its the only thing that has ever worked for my hair.

I feel like after a week my scalp is slightly less itchy, but I'm not sure that the conditioner has anything to do with it, since i don't apply conditioner to my scalp. I do like how my hair feels- it feel soft and doesn't tangle that much throughout the whole day, which is nice. I do feel like my hair looks duller, however. If you're looking for any relief this may help, but for me it's not enough of a relief to be worth the stringy, dull looking hair.

I know this review is for the conditioner but after two weeks of using both my scalp was a bit less itchy but not much of a difference. The conditioner does leave your hair silky but I found it would get my hair more oily. Overall I wasn't really impressed. I like head and shoulders but this item was just not up too my expectations.

The first several times I used it, my hair became limp and heavy and wouldn't hold curls well (it's naturally frizzy and wavy, but I can usually get light bouncy curls with a curling iron). I knew it was a result of too much conditioner. This was mainly due to the fact that this conditioner is much more potent than what I was used to. While I had to use quite a bit of my old conditioner to moisturize my thick frizzy hair, this conditioner only takes a little bit to do the same thing (read: this bottle will last you a LONG time). Once I figured that out and adjusted accordingly, I was happy with it and found my hair styled much easier!",

In my experience, dandruff/dry scalp treatments have always been marketed as a 2-in-1-type product and those always leave my hair feeling like I transplanted it with pieces of hay. This product, on the other hand, left my hair feeling smooth and smelling great. I have incredibly fine hair so if the conditioner is not of good quality, it can take me ages to brush through all the tangles after my shower however, I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case with this product. I was able to brush through my hair with ease and after blowdrying, it still smelled great and was manageable. I tested Head Shoulders for free, but all opinions are mine and mine alone.",

Slightly sweet, but not in that overly sweet, sickeningly way. There is a slight scent of almond, but it isn't too prominent. I usually use really think conditioners, or else they aren't effective, but this left my hair surprisingly soft, without being greasy. The only downside is that I didn't feel that it was any more effective at calming down my itch scalp. It worked for a day or two, but I've used products that have stopped it all together. If you use it daily, you might have better results. *I tested Head Shoulders for free, but all opinions are my own.",

I love a super creamy conditioner, which this definitely is. The smell is light and pleasant. It contains the main ingredient the shampoo does to negate the effects of dry scalp, but do to the thickness of the conditioner it does not dry out my hair. The other ingredients aren't as simple or organic as some of my other conditioners, but I still like it nonetheless. In fact contray to popular belief, most conditioners have enough cleaning agents that a shampoo isn't entirely necessary. Especially for us curly girls...Cowashes are great.

For a dandruff conditioner, it didn't have the chemical smell that I'm used to, which was definitely a bonus. The only thing worse than having dandruff is having your hair smell like you use dandruff products! The almond oil in this product makes the hair smell good. On the downside, I'm used to a thicker conditioner for my wavy hair so styling was a bit different. Nothing that I can't get used to but might benefit from a deep conditioning if used daily for longer hair. I received this product for free in a Vox Box but would buy it again.",

While many appreciate the stackable design, square shape, and freezer and dishwasher safety, some find the sealing process to be slow and unreliable.  Several reviewers report that the containers don't hold a seal properly, leading to wasted food.  Others have experienced issues with the lids leaking or cracking, despite being advertised as crack-resistant.  However, many customers love the containers for extending the freshness of their food and find them to be a worthwhile investment. \n\n\n",

                "text": "Hello FoodSaver, Thank you for asking for our opinions on your newest improved container design as we certainly feel it's important to help you to understand your customer's needs and views. We bought these containers to add to and somewhat replace our older FoodSaver containers of four years ago. Though they have a few improved features, there are some issues we found somewhat disappointing. We enjoy the new dimple vacuum indicator feature, the stack-ability, the new material of harder plastic which is easer to clean up and makes it top-rack dishwasher safe, and the easy lid disassembly for dishwashing too. Where we feel your design has fallen down a bit, is in the closure and opening ease of use. It takes quite a few times to get any of the containers to close properly for sealing and vacuum tightness. We match up the small tabs on the lid container bodies, but this doesn't seem to help. When sealing, the container adaptor for the vacuum hose always needs to be held on to the container lid port. Even though it seems to seat a bit better onto the lid port than the older models, it doesn't seem to grip in place as it should. We always need to hold down by hand on both the adaptor and lid with some pressure to help the port and the container lid make contact in order to start the sealing process. When opening the container, it is Always a Major struggle after the air is released. Trying to grip the lid and then separate the lid away from the main container body is an issue does not open easily without wrestling with both. A more elongated lid lip with which to grip onto may help, or some kind of snap-ability between body lid would facilitate easier usage, which the older containers have. We are a middle aged, healthy, dexterous, and agile couple who have No issues with any arthritic or carpal limitations. If we were senior adults with some kind hand arthritic condition, these containers would most definitely be impossible to use and manipulate. Even though there are so many improvements with these new containers, they are not as easy to use as our older ones, where you actually could snap the lid into place and the adapters seated well and firm on the lid ports. Please relate this to your engineering, design, and quality control teams and see if you can find some solutions for an even Better design. Thank you for taking the time and energy to consider our comments. Faithfully, Jimi Isaacs",

                "text": "I have been a Foodsaver for the last dozen years or more. However, I'm having the same trouble as many others with the unreliable seal on these containers. To their credit, this site has replaced one set of the new containers for me but not all I purchased. The new ones seem to work a bit better but the seals are still unreliable. I am not a novice. I keep the seals and valve clean, I have never put them in the dishwasher and in fact, always wash the lids by hand and never immerse them. I have been forced to check the seals regularly and reseal often - not what I bargained for. I have had some luck by rotating the lids to find, perhaps, if there is one rotation that seals better and then placing a small mark with permanent marker to help me use the placement that might seem to hold the seal longer. I swear some of these lids in the early manufacturing runs are warped. Sometimes I can rotate the lids to find a placement that doesn't pop up but those warped lids are hopeless and I just boxed them up and put them out in the shed until I figure a fix. (I used to help the marinator seal with a bit of vegetable oil on the seal and that seemed to help keep them sealed a bit longer but who knows. When I press them on, I can feel them pop back up - no wonder they don't seal reliably. Some are not warped. Occasionally, they will surprise me and hold the seal for a longer period but I still can count on them and must constantly go to the pantry to check to make sure my saltines or pastas are still sealed so that they don't go rancid on me too quickly but I am running out of counter space for those containers that seem to require daily re-sealing or in some cases, every six hours or so. I have tried to determine if these new containers work better in the fridge or out and they remain non-reliable for the most part no matter the environmental conditions. I have reverted to the old round canisters for storage of most dry foods as they seem to hold their seals longer. For the convenience in storing rectangular containers, I was really rooting for these to work reliably but alas... Back to the drawing board folks!",

When it works, it is excellent, as it keeps food fresh, and you can continue to reuse it over and over. However, there are a couple of issues I have with this item. It can be a major pain to get it to work at all. Often times, it is a toss up on when the device wants to behave or not. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I don't feel like I'm doing anything differently from the times it works versus the times it doesn't. Also, another major flaw is that the few times you get lucky and it actually worked, you may find that it was a false positive after all as you will notice that sometimes the dimple to let you know the air is sucked out ends up losing it's suction. This is after less than a day in the fridge. So it is a constant struggle between getting the containers to work at all and getting it to stay vacuumed. However, like I said, the few times when it works as intended, it is excellent as it has kept the suction for weeks on some items. If you are okay with the above frustrations and love the idea of these containers, go ahead and get them. At the very least, you can use them by itself as decent good looking containers. If, however, all of this seems like a huge exercise in frustration, look elsewhere.",

They are very finicky to seal, you cannot just place the lid on the container and sealyou must make sure all the connections are are tight and hold the lid down onto the container. Many times it take a couple of tries to get things just right for a seal. I've used both the food saver handheld vacuum and my actual vacuum sealer machine. After sealing them and placing them in the fridge, many containers leak air and lose their seal. I have followed all the trouble shooting tips: do not store gas-emitting foods, make sure gaskets are clean and dry, etc. In summary, I'm glad I bought these on sale. I would not want to pay full price based on the performance. Double check your containers everyday to make sure they are still sealed.",

Initially impressed with container construction, appearance, stackability and capacities. Upon unpacking and wiping clean, vac'd each container. The black green adapter stem is smaller in diameter than gray one. Does work with hand held vac but not well. Leaks around stem. On the containers only one held vac 3hrs (10c). Tried several times. Washed in warm water and tried again. Same results w/5c 8c. Over next 2 weeks tried storing fresh fruits, leftovers and just empty containers. Cleaned lid seals vac valves with Q-tip to ensure clean. None of the containers held vac 1day. Although size and construction very good w/o vac just expensive storage containers. Ended up returning. The 3c I still have has had lid seal removed, cleaned and inspected under magnifier. Can't see any damage but still will not hold vac 8hrs.",

I never heard an SNAP like the directions indicated on any of the containers. After much (too much) frustration, I finally got them all sesled. They do appear to stay sealed when empty I have used a couple in the fridge that are still sealed after 2 days. After reading other reviews, it seems I will have to check the seals often. This set is not NEARLY as easy to use as previous FoodSaver containers. I have very weak arms hands so this is a big deal. The older style containers were easy to plop the lid on, seal, go! I have to wedge a spoon between the lid bottom to remove the lid after the seal has been released. Time will tell if these new improved containers are worth the money frustration.

I would estimate that 30 of the lids leak. I may have solved this issue, though only time will tell. If I put a few drops of olive oil on the valves after removing the plastic valve cover, the leakage appears to have stopped, at least for now.

The use was a bit tricky as the lids don't snap (audibly) and the accessory hose must sit just right on the lid to create a seal that allows for vacuum seal to completely form. Any slight jiggle or misalignment of the hose piece on the oval on the lid and the sealer will just stay on (noisily) without making progress on the green light on my food saver machine and then you have to guess to troubleshoot why seal isn't completing its vacuum seal. Opening the lids too is a bit tricky. Once the pressure has been released and the container ready to open, it's tough to grab the top edge of lid and the bottom container in a way to open carefully to prevent the contents for flying everywhere. I do like the BPA free plastic, no stain and no odor residue on plastic too!! Also, I like the 10c container for pantry items like flour and sugar or cereal. None of my containers snap when I placed lid so often the lid would be a poor seal and fail to seal with accessory hose. I like the accent color, BPA-free plastic that is stain and odor resistant!

I don't really see it here on this site, but there's one thing that's so important, everyone should know sure you save because you don't throw your food away, and sure the bags seal well, the containers do pretty good however the foods we eat are always fresh. and that alone is worth the price. yes we save money, but we eat fresh every day. We had a giant cantaloupe, which I would have never purchased at the grocery, until my girlfriend came home with it. no problem, we chopped it up, stored it inside these containers, and 3 weeks later, we're finally finished with it. and that's all good, food lasts a long time, weeks, and we don't throw food away, we can buy in bulk, but the food is always fresh. I also think sometimes these containers can be a bit tough to get open. so if you have trouble opening a canning jar, you might need some help with these canisters. Otherwise, they're worth their weight in saffron. I can't see living without these canisters, my vacuum bags and new vacuum sealer. I recommend these canisters to anyone, especially a family that needs to save money on food.",

Then, and only then, will you have evacuated as much air as is possible with this product, which will in turn considerably extend the number of days (up to a week, I've found) that the vacuum will last.",

I had always used just the rolls and made my own sealing bags, sealing my meat purchases. When storing left overs I usually would just put them into a glad ware or like product and stick it into the fridge. Since my husband passed away I no longer cook big meals, but still like to buy in bulk when I can to save a few dollars. So when I discovered that Food Saver had vacuum food containers (ok, so I'm a little slow) I was excited to say the least. I jumped into this new convenience with both feet. I purchased 3 of the NEW FoodSaver Fresh Container, 4-Piece Set's. Wow, their great. Now when I purchase a good size bag of lettuce greens I can count on the lettuce greens lasting all the way till I finish them. No longer does it turn into a frazzled edged limp bag of Euck. Now I can buy the big container of sour cream and transfer it to the big seal container and it will last what seems forever. I now use my seal a meal containers for everything. When I open a big can of carrots, peas, green beans, etc., I can now seal the rest in a container and not have to worry that it will go bad before I can use up the rest. I love the way they look, so clean and neat looking. I can find everything I need in the fridge. My next purchase is going to be to buy some more of the smaller containers, I can't seem to get enough of those. Food Saver, you've done it again. Congratulations on a great product.",

I used them for lettuce, red chile, cookies, leftovers, and deli meat. In just a few weeks I was able to save money because I didn't have to toss out food that went bad. There are a good variety of sizes for the containers, which makes it easy to store a wide variety of items. Overall, these containers are amazing and I highly recommend them for anyone that wants to cut down on how much food they throw out each week because they can't keep it fresh.

We normally end up throwing extra ones away but the food saver I have been able to reuse them later. As of two weeks in I have not had to throw any food away. I have went from fridge to microwave, serves food and not had any issues. There has no staining nor odors which is something I have not seen before. The food saver containers will allow for easy storage and a lot less waste in any household. I know I plan on replacing all my storage containers with food saver products.

                "text": "I love these new canisters. They are nice looking and seem to hold up well, so far. The new dimple feature is great. I lets you see if the vacuum is taking place, by indenting as the vacuuming process is taking place and also lets you know, at a glance, if the seal has been maintained over time. I've only had one instance of vacuum failure. I also like the curved corners, which let you squeeze down on the lid to ensure proper closure and the nesting feature, which is an improvement over the old canisters. With the old canisters, you can only nest different sizes. Same size canisters cannot be nested and take up a lot of space. The only small negative about these is that when releasing the vacuum, the lid is a little difficult to remove, but is tolerable, considering the overall improvement in the design. I only have one suggestion about the canisters. I would like to see some additional configurations for the 5 and 8 cup canisters, more like the 10 cup, which is horizontal rather than upright. In a horizontal design, a 5 and 8 cup canisters could be used for things such as cold cuts. In the present configuration, cold cuts can't be laid out. In addition, they are a more difficult fit in the lower shelves of my fridge. I'm not suggesting a replacement, but an addition to the current lineup. Overall, these are the best containers Food Saver has ever made, by far.",

First of all, they are very sturdy and you can see through them, unlike some other brands of containers (opening something that's green and fuzzy isn't fun). Another feature is you can use them either vacuum sealed or not, freeze or microwave reheat in them. I had strawberries in one for a bit over two weeks that were still good. What more could a person want",

They are very easy to use and very obviously show if the container is sealed right on the lid. The sealing function is quite obvious, plug and seal, and takes just a few seconds. I appreciate the multiple sizes of the containers as they are large enough to fit almost every need. In my fridge they did take up a decent amount of room so I'm not sure I'd use them often for long term fridge storage. I do use them frequently for pantry storage (crackers/cookies) and freezer storage (cookies/scones). The clear containers allow you to easily see what is inside. As much as I appreciate the storage aspect I do have to say that the microwave usage surprised me. They performed great in the microwave, the food warmed and the container did not! I was shocked. Clean up was a breeze too, even spaghetti sauce left for days did not stain these containers. You can pop them into the dishwasher and they clean right up. The only negative I can think of is that the vacuum valve cover is a little difficult to remove, I wish they had added a little grab tab or something to assist in removing. But since you only remove this to clean the top lid, I suppose its a minor inconvenience. Disclaimer: I received this product free as an advance sample in exchange for a detailed and honest review.

The plastic is durable and high quality I stored pasta sauce in it and it didn't stain or retain any odor. I microwaved it and ran it through the dishwasher (bottom section only) and they came out good as new. They are very easy to use with the adapter and the foodsaver vacuum hose although I would recommend running the vacuum sealer a little longer than when the indicator indents to make sure you get a full seal. They maintain a tight seal until you release and everything I store in them stays fresh for so much longer. They also have bigger sizes than any vacuum seal containers I've ever used so you can even make big batches of soup or chili and be able to store them in these much larger sizes! Just a word to the wise, the tight fit of the lid--which allows for the great vacuum seal--can make it a little tricky to open the containers if they are full of a liquid like soup or chili. Overall I love these containers and would recommend them to anyone that has a foodsaver vacuum sealer! I received this as a free sample to review. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

I love fruit but it tends to go bad too quickly in the refrigerator so usually buy in very small amounts. I bought a large group of green grapes and stored them in one of these containers and although it took me a while to finish the grapes they were all still very firm and delicious. I prewashed them and had pulled them all off of the vine prior to putting them in my container also so very convenient. You don't even have to remove the air from the container for most fruits too. Salads are wonderful also and stay good. Usually just make what I need for a meal but now am able to make more at a time, store it, remove the air, and it stays good. Very easy to do also. Thanks!!!!",

I tried putting salad mix in the large 10-cup container and remarkably it stayed much fresher than the unsealed bag I got from the store.

I have had fresh picked blueberries in 1 for about 2 - 3 months and there is no ice buildup and no problems with the seal. I also love that I'm not throwing away as much plastic!

I bought 6/7 of each size and use everyone of them for something (dry/wet items). The BIGGEST improvement is the BUBBLE/SEAL on top to indicate a seal. You just check the bubble and that's IT. So simple. They are worth the extra ., you'll get your moneys worth every time you use them, and they are just F-A-N-S-A-T-I-C. Very highly recommended.",

I thought that was what they were designed for, but . . . . . the manufacturer wrote to me and said they were only intended to be used once. A direct quote from FoodSaver (JCS Customer Service), The zipper bags are resealable for every day use, however we do not recommend that they be washed and reused because it might compromise the ability to create a proper vacuum.

Normally I have to add a little, I always thought it was normal, but with these containers I didn't have to. None of the moisture escaped and no fridge flavors snuck in. I used the 10 cup storage container for my prepped vegetables and loved the fact that on Sunday I was able to prep for the entire week and they were still in fantastic shape and flavor after that full week. I used the 5 cup for my long grain white rice and after being stored in the pantry I was amazed by the freshness that was apparent from the big aroma of rice that hit me when I opened the container. I have enjoyed the ease of use and how stackable they are. Amazing for storage and being stored. I was able to try this product for free and very thrilled that I had this experience. I definitely need to get more of these containers. Fabulously fresh food and easy organization. Five star all the way! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

I was frustrated with the design at first until I realized you REALLY had to press hard to close the lids so they would vacuum properly. Once I saw the little button on the lid sink in, I knew I was in business! (You'll know what I mean when you use yours for the first time!) And the way the accessory locks onto the lid is so much better than the old smaller containers. This product really ROCKS!!",

I bought these containers primarily for lettuce because that is the one fresh food item that frequently spoiled. I love the 10-cup for lettuce.

With daily use and resealing after each use, the berries stayed firm. Green beans did just as well. My 5 cup container does just as well with blueberries or anything else I have tried.

The above notwithstanding, we have had an occasional, albeit quite rare, sealing issue with these containers, all of which were quickly rectified by disassembling the vacuum port on the lid, including removing and cleaning the rubber seal valve itself.

But I've seen things like these containers before and haven't been happy in the past. I reluctantly decided to give it a go. I am so impressed. They do just what they promise. My shelf life of vegetables has doubled or tripled in some cases. This is a huge savings for my wife and myself as it is just the two of us and we just can't use up the produce fast enough sometimes. I've already ordered a second set and some individual pieces. I know what I am going to be giving for Christmas this year to some of my FoodSaver friends.",

Being a household of 2 I needed something that would keep my cheese, sour cream, salsa etc and found the containers perfect for all of it. Love the small round one for sour cream for sure.

That worked pretty good, but meant traveling with glass, and jars are hard to eat out of. With these containers, I've had salads stay fresh for 7 days. These containers seal much easier and faster than the jars. They NEVER lose their seal (mason jars sometimes did, especially when changing elevations). I sealed all of them with and without food to test. I simply could not pull them apart. They are very easy to eat out of and much easier to wash. I love that they are stackable also. The one and only downside is that they take up much more room in a fridge or cooler than a mason jar does. But they hold more also.",

I read a review once when someone commented that they were replacing all their containers with these FoodSaver containers and I can certainly see why! There is just no comparison. The amount of food we didn't have to throw away is worth many times the cost of this set. We even had hamburger buns that stayed fresh for about a month in one of these containers. I will probably be one of those that also wants to replace all my containers with these.

Namely, that I suspect that many of those complaining about these containers losing their vacuum after a few hours -- particularly the 'baby' of the family, this 3 cup one -- must either have a defective unit and should return it, or are stopping the vacuum as soon as the dimple collapses, because ours generally remain sealed..... well...... indefinitely, it seems. Particularly in the freezer. The trick being -- with a hand-held vac, at least -- to keep on vacuuming as the pitch of the motor drops, and to only stop when the pitch starts to rise again, signalling that no more air can be be removed. My only complaint, in fact, being with their 'Freshbucks' program, which tantalizingly offers this 3-cupper for 10,000 points on their site, but have it permanently marked as 'sold out', which rather defeats the purpose of a 'special offer' or 'reward', no!",

Cut up several bunches of lettuce for salad and put in one of the new containers. STILL nice and crisp. Celery hearts the same. One bit of advise. When I store veggies I make sure they are DRY before storing them. Any water will cause them to go soggy after a few days. Carrots are washed and dried and not peeled bell peppers are sliced up and patted dry. Cucumbers are washed to remove any wax, sliced, skin on and the are good for a long time. These containers are perfect. Hats off to FoodSaver, they have come a LONG way in the 25 years we have used their products!!!!!",

I have been using FoodSaver system for about eight years now daily and love it, but have always been disappointed with the containers lack of quality which did not allow the system to work to its full potential. With the new FoodSaver containers all of that is history. At first I started with one of the sets to test them out because they obviously cost more then the old containers. However, the fact that these are made from bpa-free material is great for food safety and the material that is super durable just like the one I use in my big name blender. The new sealing system used with these containers has proven to work. As long as you do the normal procedures by making sure you have a clean container lip before connecting, the seals last. Also, you can use these in the freezer which I have done. The seal holds well and have had not one fail yet in my few month freezer test. Overall I thoroughly enjoy these and just purchased another such as these are now replacing all my containers.",

A little bit of a learning curve to get a proper seal, but once you have it ... easy-peasy :-)",

I consumed all but one wedge and left it in the container to see when it got the rusty look. This is what that lettuce looked liked on Feb 2nd. Very little browning and still crispy and edible. Cabbage lasts longer also without browning. It does have a more intense odor being sealed. FOODSAVER is the best for freezing anything. It hardly ever leaks air in and stays vacuum sealed for months. I have used generic bag rolls and they do not seal very well. Throw away more than use. Thought I would share. Keeps food longer in refrigerator and freezer. I have used the FOODSAVER for several years and using my second one now. I have shared this post on Facebook with my friends and getting inquiries. Thanks FOODSAVER!!!!",

But just yesterday 1/26/17, I went to see if I could use the green pepper, and oh my gosh, it was fresh like the day I bought it. The cucumber is still in there and when I checked it it was just getting a little soft, just wasn't quite as hard as the first day, but still very usable yet. We'll see avocado is about like the cucumber. Like I said I have 2 sets of these, and most all of the other foodsaver containers. I cleared out my cupboards and only have those in there.",

These NEW 'Fresh Containers', are WAY BETTER, than the older model containers with the white lids. (5 decent size sandwiches) were made and sealed, to cover the week. I ate them for breakfast, and was planning on them getting me through a 5 day work week. Every morning I grabbed one out, then vacuumed them immediately and back in the fridge. Here is the kicker- I ended up, being called for work, to another city for a week, after eating the 2nd sandwich. I thought there would be NO WAY, they would still be edible when I returned 9 days after originally making them... They were fine, they smelt fine, tasted fine, and I actually ate the last one 13 days after I had made them. I will be purchasing several more of these in the future They seem to be the perfect size, and really hold that vacuum seal. I'm looking forward to also trying the 10 cup 'Fresh Container' for Spinach or Mixed salads to start. (buyer, not free tester)",

Recommend getting the little green trays for in the bottom as they really do help (better than a paper towel) to keep moisture or natural juices off of the fruits/veggies. That store bought bag lettuce which last 2-3 days, now last 10-14 days. Kept it that long it just to see! My only problem is: FoodSaver needs to come out with bigger containers to hold a whole head of lettuce, full length celery, and for storing fresh garden vegetables in bulk. Bell peppers are too widehigh for rectangular container 2 won't fit side by side in 8cup container. In response to the person whom said they must re-seal them every few days: I found that running my sealer 5-10 seconds longer helps to assure a perfect seal keeps the little green bubble indented until I open the container.",

Its like sticking a band aid on a dirty arm, dirt prevents glue from sticking to the skin same principle here only with whatever dust is in the container getting sucked up breaking the seal.",

Cut up several bunches of lettuce for salad and put in one of the new containers. STILL nice and crisp. Celery hearts the same. One bit of advise. When I store veggies I make sure they are DRY before storing them. Any water will cause them to go soggy after a few days. Carrots are washed and dried and not peeled bell peppers are sliced up and patted dry. Cucumbers are washed to remove any wax, sliced, skin on and the are good for a long time. These containers are perfect. Hats off to FoodSaver, they have come a LONG way in the 25 years we have used their products!!!!!",

While some praise its light hold, pleasant scent, and alcohol-free formula, others find it lacking in staying power, particularly for humid conditions or longer days.  Some describe it as sticky or leaving hair feeling dull, while others appreciate its non-sticky texture and ability to tame flyaways.  Overall, it seems to work well for those seeking a light hold but may not be suitable for those needing  stronger hold.\n\n\n\n\n",

I expected this to be pretty good as I think it is fair to say that most people equate Pantene with consistent quality, but I was very disappointed. It comes in a good size can, with very attractive packaging, and has little to no scent that I could discern. I found this hairspray to leave my hair a mangled mess. Whether I used it on freshly washed and styled hair, or on 3 day old hair, I found it to have almost no hold on my hair (to be fair, it is advertised as Air Spray, with light, flexible hold). The problem is not the hold for me though, its what comes when you brush it out - my hair turns into a hot mess that is difficult to brush, it looks flat and lifeless, and becomes frizzy until I wash the hairspray out. I have never had that experience, whether I was using my TIGI Catwalk Your Highness or my go-to hairspray, Aussie MEGA, none of them have ever done that to my hair. The worst part of all, however, is the film that it leaves behind on my counter, sink, and virtually every hard surface it comes in contact with. Maybe I received a bad can, but I won't be giving it another go to see.",

Which in all regards is fine, but there are a lot of claims with this product that fell short, for me personally. The product on my hair was a little sticky, and it claims it had brushable flexible hold, not really seeing this happen. In fact I would recommend that, if you like your hair to stay on your head. I could go on, but I think I've said enough. In short, if you're looking for just hairspray, this is the one and the scent doesn't completely make you cough and gag, which is a plus!",

It does feel like regular hair spray when you spray it on, the hold is average at best. I will not be purchasing this product, it is sticky when I sprayed it on my hair then dried hard so when I went to comb my hair out at the end of the day it made tangles and I had to pull hard on my hair to get the comb through it and every hair counts when your hair is so fine like mine. Overall, I think Pantene should stick to making shampoo and conditioner and not hair spray! I thought the name of the 'Airspray' was great marketing but the hair spray fell flat, no pun intended.",

It keeps my long hair in place beautifully and it's holding up well in the humid summer weather. My only caveat is to hold it the recommended 8-12 inches away from your hair or it will blow your hairstyle out of place. I absolutely recommended it. It's another winner from Pantene.",

The air spray as it says on the can does not contain alcohol and leaves your hair feeling great. It is absolutely a brushable hold. The only thing I didn't like is the sound it makes when you spray the can. Don't be alarmed if your dogs suddenly start barking at you like mine did. It is a little loud forced air sound.",

After a couple years of use, I still smile when I pull perfectly clean dishes out of the dishwasher. Thank you, Lemi Shine!",

I had a hard time not getting nail glue all over my fingers, even with the Self-Tabs on it, and once they were finally on and securely glued, I had a hard time keeping them on. Within the first 2 days, I had to glue 3 different nails back on, and after the 3rd day of having 3 different nails pop off, I finally decided to just take them all off. I'd suggest if using them, have someone else help you put them on. And I also suggest, even though the box says 7 days of normal day wear, to only expect a day or two out of them.

I had so many problems with these nails. The set I got was short which I thought I was ok because I had just cut my nails down to start over. But I ended up having to cut my nails almost to the quick to get them to the right length so they wouldn't look crazy. I hate having my nails that short because I hate the feeling. Next thing was gluing the nails on. This was pretty easy and simple. The hard part was sorting the nails to the right finger which got difficult when it came to my middle and ring fingers. But I got through it. After having the on and for less than 24 hours, the thumb popped off. This is why I never liked press on's. Through out the next two to three days, I had a lot of pop offs. All of them coming off while I was at work. Talk about embarassing. Once the end of the week came, I only had one still on. That was the thumb that had popped off at first. I guess I had to do double gluings in order for them to stay on. I did like how professional they looked. They looked real good on my hands but I guess the glue wasn't holding on. I didn't have to worry about chips from the paint or them cracking or breaking so that's good. But I didn't have to much of a good thing with them.",

The problem for me is that ALL my fingers required size 11 (which there are only 2 of), because my nail beds are longer and my fingernails are so narrow, and I had to do a lot of filing down. My thumbs were no problem. They were a good product, but probably easier to use for someone who has more normal/proportionate fingernails. Also, if you are just looking for a quick spruce up, for an event that evening, these nails are perfect. Don't start doing yard work or a lot of dishes, but they should have no problem hanging on for a few days if you aren't rough on them. Much better for your nails then getting gel or acrylic put on and (as long as you don't have to resize them all) a lot quicker!",

I haven't had my nails done in ages and I wanted my hands to feel pretty again. The problem is that even with excessive filing and shaping the nails did not fit my small and nearly nonexistent nail bed. Obviously not the fault of this product and strictly genetics but I couldn't even properly try them. When I did finally get one that would fit to my nails, you could see my very short nail through the very translucent fake nail and it ruined the effect. The nails popped off easily and within less than 30 minutes I had lost two nails, and more shortly afterwards. Again, not saying it is the fault of the product entirely but, I can't with good conscious recommend them to others, especially after browsing the reviews of others. Sadly this was a fail for me and most Kiss products I've tried in the past are great so maybe it's a fluke! Ether way, very grateful to Influenster AND Kiss for allowing me to test and review this product.",

My nails have been nice though. Have the press on nails is like a little treat for me. I just feel better when my nails are done or painted! They were quick and simple to apply just find the right size apply the glue press and hold then snap off the little number tab and you're good to go. They look great, not cheap and took minutes to apply rather than a long time in the salon. Now it may just be that I didn't sit long enough before I started doing stuff with them but I did have two pop over that I had to reapply. They were easily out back on though and I haven't had any come off since.",

It says on the instructions that they are supposed to last up to 10 days, but mine only lasted for three. Each day one or two nails would come off and I would have to re-glue them back on one by one. Finally, I ran out of glue and gave up. Now I might have been putting them on wrong, but when I did first put them on I was thoroughly impressed with them and I thought they looked amazing (which they were). Remember to put on a clear coat after apply it makes they look so elegant.",

My previous experience with this kind of nail product made me skeptical but I tried it out and got a little better than I thought I would. Bottom line, if you have an event or something coming up and you don't have time (or money) to get your nails done this is an acceptable short term solution just don't go expecting your new manicure to last a very long time. My first nail popped off on the second day of regular wear, glued that one back down but the next more 3 others had popped off and there was no re-gluing them. Also, as with any nail product that uses adhesive this will tear some of your nail up so I would not recommend if you have weak nails or are trying to grow them out on your own.",

The nails weren't overly heavy and felt very natural on. It almost made you forget that you were wearing artificial nails. I work in retail so I am constantly working with my hands and banging my nails on everything. I loved that the color didn't chip away. Usually salon manicures last me about a day, this one lasted much longer. Ease of Removal: I must have put too much glue when I used this product because I had a hard time taking them off. I had to soak my fingers in acetone for quite some time to get them off. Aftermath: I felt like my natural nails were a bit damaged from the press on nails. I don't know if that was ultimately worth the cost of a nice manicure for a week. Personally I think I rather have healthy nails and perhaps a bit of chipping, or healthy nails that I have to retouch every few days. Final Verdict: I don't think I would personally buy this myself, I prefer a bit more color on my nails. I would however consider buying their colored variety nails.",

The application is super easy (though the glue can get everywhere if you're not careful), and the longest process is probably figuring out the best size for each nail. The length of the nails are way too long for my liking, and these are the real short length. I like to keep my natural nails very short and the length of these interfered with just normal, everyday activities. I do think most people would like this length, though, it's just my own personal preference. I also prefer my nails to be more rounded as opposed to the squared off end. These nails are great for someone who wants a no muss, no fuss nail application for a good price. Though I will also add that I think every one of my nails has popped off within the past three days doing normal things, like opening a door, grabbing a water bottle and putting on a jacket. However, I don't know if that's due to my not using enough glue during application. I won't be repurchasing these, but I don't think this is a bad product. They're just not for me.",

                "text": "I've been a fan of Kiss' press-on products for a few years now so I was really excited to try their Everlasting French kit when I received it as a sample from Influenster. Since it was my first time using a glue-on style fake nail there was a bit of a learning curve but I managed to have both hands done in under 15 minutes and man did they look gorgeous! The main issue I was having was knowing just how much glue each nail needed to set properly. For the first few fingers I had enough to make them stick but you could see if you looked at them closely that there were parts where no glue was. This also became a problem the next day when my 4 year old had a tantrum in a store and as I went to pick her up she caught one and it ripped off right there in the store. Ouch!!! After a day wearing them though I found that because my natural nails are VERY flat my fingers were all very sore from the pressure of the nails trying to lay curved. So I went and bought some acetone polish remover and spent the better part of an hour (we were watching a movie and it took more than 2/3 of it to get them and all the glue off). It was not my idea of easy at all. Not to mention the fact that it was extremely messy. So overall, while these are awesome looking and will last for days they might not be for flat fingered types or those who don't want to spend an hour getting them off. I would, however, highly recommend them for special occasions like weddings or as a budget friendly alternative to going to the salon for those who don't mind the removal process.",

I loved the way they looked at first glance and was even happier when I took them out and started to figure out what sizes to use for my nails. I am not an expert by any means on how to apply fake nails, and while I found that application was a bit messy (it could be just me!) securing the fake nail to your nails was not. I love that they had a small tab which was very helpful in not touching the glue after it had been applied (That is some strong stuff, let me tell you). They were still a bit longer than expected, so I filed them down. But all in all it looks good.",

What I did not like about them was the application process. The glue was a little messy. I began to do them myself, but my friend helped me do my right hand. At one point her finger got stuck to my nail. 30 minutes after we applied them my thumb and pointer nail fell off. I glued them back on, and have not had them on for about 14 hours including a shower, and mopping. Overall I do like these nails, I just wished they would upgrade the kind of glue they provide, even if they are a dollar or two more.",

When I first got them, my initial impression was meh. I usually get my nails done at a salon and have never considered any of these home kits. After opening the package and reading the instructions, my first thoughts were that: 1. it seemed like an easy process to to put on. 2. I liked that there were multiple sizes. 3. They were soft and flexible (looked like it would fit the nail well) I decided to try them on immediately and wow! --they were definitely easy to put on! I loved that you could file them down (easily) to match your nail shape. Putting them on, they looked great on my nails. Very natural and pretty! I also liked that because you glued them on, you could easily add designs on the nail prior to gluing them. The only con is that if you've never done them before (like me), you could get air bubbles. Anyways, the nails looked so great and I immediately got compliments from my family. They're supposed to last a couple days, however, I think due to my mistake of not gluing them on correctly, but also because I was trying on wetsuits, I did manage to take one off the 2nd day I wore them. So I did end up taking them off and I have to say that it was easy to remove also. They removed painlessly (I was terrible, I pulled them off) and my nails look fine. Final thoughts: I can't believe I used to pay 40 for salon french tips (acrylics). Never again. These totally won me over to the home kits and I like that they're customizable! Love them! BUY THEM.

                "text": "This was my first time to apply artificial nails in thirty years and it will probably be another thirty years until I do it again. Long nails just aren't for me. I usually file my nails down to the quick so I can't really get used to these but if you are used to having long nails, whether real or artificial, you'll really like these. The tab makes them easy to apply and each tab is numbered with its size so you can easily find its mate for your other hand. It's a good idea to write the numbers and in what order they are applied so you won't have to do it the next time. Fit them to the sides of your nail, not just the nail bed to find your best fit. Bear in mind that the numbers are guidelines for the opposite hands but that the sizes may vary so be sure to test before applying. This is not some innocuous nail glue, this is Super Glue and bonding time in is milliseconds so there's no time for trial and error. The tab helps with placement and the nail could not be put on easily without it so be careful not to bend it too much before you apply it. I made an error and ended up having to soak my finger in an acetone-based nail polish remover for an hour (no kidding) to nail that I had gotten out of sequence. I'm not a patient woman so if you're likely to mess up, you might want to get someone to help you apply the nails. There is a no-chip guarantee and I can attest that the nails are quite durable and I doubt you could chip them with a sandblaster. So these are definitely long-lasting. The pale pink nail and white crescent of the classic French manicure is quite pretty and is high quality. There is also a pale peach and white for those who prefer that color instead. If you like the look, they have Kiss everlasting French in Toes, too, for that perfect pedicure.",

My only issue was the glue which came out of the tube too fast and left my fingertips feeling rough for a few days after it dried. Aside from that, these are great nails!",

I've not liked press on nails for years after trying them once or buying the kiddy ones for the daughters and they always come right off or break, chip are just flimsy pathetic. Well this was exactly the opposite to my surprise. I was so very happy. I was able to put them on with ease. I didn't have a long time to wait for the glue to dry, it was almost instant. The nails were almost real feeling hard. At times I was typing away while working couldn't even remember I had on fake nails. I was highly impressed. I love acrylic nails never thought I'd say that these might just replace the acrylic nails because one, they are totally affordable two they come in so many fun patterns and colors three they come off much sooner you don't have to have them on all the time to worry about or anything. You have a special occasion if your like me finding time to beautify yourself such as nails and toes can be quite the chore. This was so quick simple that you put on, do a lil filing and out the door you can go. You can almost safely put them on in the car while on your way to the special occasion if your not the one driving, its that quick, simple easy. I will keep one on hand at all times for those emergency moments. I must also tell you that out about I didn't feel that my nails looked fake so that I'd be insecure if someone noticed them would think right off the bat that I had on press on nails. They really looked great!. A for a rating from me. Kiss everlasting French Manicure KissProducts everlastingfrench Received this product complimentary for testing purposes",

I liked that these are classic french tips what I didn't like to much was that the natural nail part did had a color tint to it that some skin tones won't be able to work with it. Lucky for me it went well with my skin tone so there was no issues. I like how easy it was to apply them on and how long they lasted. Even after I took them all off the nails were still in shape and can be used a second time aswell.",

First, the nails are made of quality material and they keep their shape when applying. They are sturdy, but still able to bend to fit your nail. They also hold up well to daily wear and tear like typing. I also liked that the nails were a natural looking length and the set included a wide range of widths to fit a broad spectrum of nails sizes. The coloring was also very pleasing and professional looking. This are perfect for week, a wedding, or an evening out. The nails stay on well using the included adhesive. They do not chip and quick to apply. Perfect for when you need a manicure on the go.",

However, I have a professional job and my hands need to look professional at all times. Some days I just don't have the time to devote to my nails and these are perfect for those days. I still prefer to do my nails myself and let my real nail speak for itself but I will use these for sure in a pinch. They looked natural enough to pass for a salon manicure at a glance. There were enough different sizes included in the box that fit was not an issue. They are also very affordable and readily available.",

The tabs allow easy application, no worrying about getting the nails stuck to your fingers anymore. The nails are flexible and with lots of extra nails you're more likely to find one that fits your nail bed. The short length makes them easy to handle once you have them on. I did have to file the thumbnail down because the length was still long, but they file easily so you can shape them any way you want. I buffed my nail bed up a little to make sure there was a rough surface for the glue to adhere to. Just a little tip for anyone who tries these in the future :)",

There is a huge variety of sizes available in the pack so there should be something for pretty much everyone. Once I had all my sizes picked out application was just a breeze and only took a few minutes for all my nails. My only caution is to add plenty of glue but be careful of adding to much because it can flood your cuticle a little but will peel off once it dries.",

You can do these in the comfort of your own home with the assurance your new Kiss nails will last up to a week with no chips! They are gorgeous and come in a variety of styles, but the Short Length French Pearl Tip is my favorite. It's a classic, and the short length is good for girls on the go! No worries about them getting caught on something and falling off. These are great! Much cheaper than other artificial nails and a ton cheaper than gel nails or acrylics at a salon!",

I had to file the edges down to smooth them out but after that they looked really nice! My problem with them is that they did not last 7 days at all. On my third day my thumb nail fell off.

I got these free from Influenster for testing purposes and to put my review out there. When I received my Spring Fling Vox box I was excited that i got a product that I could try out and give myself a little much needed pampering. I followed the application directions to the T and still managed to get glue all over my fingers and the tops of my nails. Some of the curvature of the nail didn't match the curvature of my natural nail. They were at a decent length, usually the same length i keep my real nails. You could see the glue underneath on a few nails but I honestly think that was something I did wrong. Sizing was alright I could probably use the rest of the nails in the package even though it's not a perfect fit. They started popping off after about 2 days, which was fine by me. I'll probably purchase these again if I have a special occasion that i need to look like a lady instead of a mom of two boys. All and all, if you're into press ons and diy manicures these are worth it.",

My natural nail bed and nails are actually longer than the Real Short Length French Nails. The product was quite pretty, easy enough to use, and seemed pretty sturdy, so I would still recommend the product to friends who don't have the same luck with growing out their natural nails. It's easier and cheaper than going to a salon and getting french tips applied, and are simple enough that young girls can wear them for fun, too.",

I just wish they would have lasted longer then 24 hours before starting to fall off. However I would use this product again. The nails did not look fake when on. They were easy to put on and looked good. I really liked that they were shorter then the average press on nail and that the polish did not chip at all. Again great product just wish I would have been able to wear them longer.",

I would totally recommend this to a friend. These are great too, because I can't have long nails in my line of work (esthetics). So they're the perfect weekend mani!

I got them in the medium length but if I were to buy these on my own I would look for the shorter ones because I had to file these down a lot. The biggest problem I had though was finding nails to fit each finger which was a bummer because I was only able to get one manicure out of it vs two I have small hands so that may not be an issue for everyone. Overall they are good for what they are and if I needed a manicure but didn't have the time I would look into these again.",

It doesn't take long to put on and looks perfect. You don't even have to worry about smudges like with nail polish. French manicures are classic they go with everything from jeans to the most formal wear. I would definitely purchase this product in the future if I had an event.

The glue dries really fast and you don't have to worry about slippage or anything like that because of it. I did get some air spots under a few of my nails and I've had about three come off since I put them on three days ago, but I was just able to file the glue down and reapply them with more glue. It is really quite simple and I've received many complements on how natural the nails look as well as the length. There are 28 in a box and that is more than enough to get the perfect fit for your nails and I am fairly certain mine will last the full 10 days - if another falls off, I'll keep my glue handy and just reapply them!

I've also never been a fan of a plain french so I jazzed them up throughout the week with a couple of manis and which I was able to wear for three days each, no top coat and not a single chip. They honestly held better than polish on my natural nails. But speaking of natural nails, I must move on to the only thing I disliked about these pretties: The aftermath. My nails gave always been relatively weak but removing my falsies left them insanely rigged, weak, and brittle even after 45 minutes of buffing/drowning in cuticle oil. I had one pop off and replaced it with regular super glue instead of the glue provided with the nails and that one nail turned out better than the rest, so I'll probably use regular glue if I ever decide to go the falsies route again.

I have officially had my nails on for a week, and I believe they are almost ready to come off. The nails were very easy to apply - tip: make sure you put glue near the edges on both your nail and the artificial nail - air bubbles will cause your nail to pop right off the next day. Also, careful not to get glue on the artificial nail - it messes up the topcoat and looks horrible. Once applied, I did normal chores like washing dishes, bathing kids, cooking, cleaning. I think the life of a few of nails were shortened by the hot water I use to clean and wash dishes. I noticed them starting to loosen after that. The box says wear over 7 days is not recommended, and it can be removed by acetone polish remover. I've taken a few off and can say, have a nail buffer and some hardening polish ready, because your nails will be weak afterwards! (which happens with every artificial nail application) Overall, it was a great fix-up for boring short nails - it made it look like I had a salon manicure",

Surprisingly, however, the instructions were quite simple and the actual application was too. It was literally glue and stick em on. Not to mention, they looked fantastic and pretty similar to its salon counterpart. The only thing I didnt like about the nails was the fact that they were a little fragile.

I just had to file a bit off. -The color of the nails look just as if I had had my nails done in the salon. -The length is just perfect. I like having long nails, but if they're too long they just cause problems. These are just the right length. They appear a bit long, but they are short enough to accomplish everyday tasks. Cons: -It seemed like I had to use far too much glue to get the nails to stick properly. I put a good sized dot in the middle and had to end up putting more on all around the nail. -If you look closely at the glued on nail, you can see some 'bubbles'. I thought it was because I wasn't using enough glue, but if I had put any more on, I'd have glue everywhere!!",

I found that several of the nails sizes were fine to fit my nails and they were actually comfortable. Other fake nails I have used actually hurt when I wear them. I wore these for a few days without wanting to take them off. They also are realistic-looking. Several friends and family members asked if I had gotten a manicure at the salon. The cons: The nails claim to be chip-free for seven days, however towards the end of the first day of wear one of the white parts of the nail started peeling away and snagging on my clothes, towels, anything cloth that I touch. That was disappointing. The nails also did not wear as long as I hoped they would before the glue came undone. Overall: While I probably wouldn't wear these all the time, they are great for once-in-a-while. The price is right and for me they are more convenient than scheduling a manicure.",

Kiss Everlasting French Nails were easy to put on, just apply the glue and press them into place. I was sent the real short length which works well for my lifestyle of chasing a toddler.

Of course they do not last as long as an acrylic set but they still give me that girly, cute, clean cut feeling. My reason for knocking off one star is because the glue could be a little more adhesive. Sometimes the nails will snap off and I would not even notice until later but I suppose you get what you pay for. All around, I would recommend. Tips: Apply a generous amount of the nail glue when you apply the nails, and use the tool to wipe the excess before it dries. This will eliminate some possible bubbles and will make them stay on a while longer. Wait AT LEAST 30 minutes before you decide to pull up those skinny jeans or anything like that. It might even be better to have someone help you apply them it makes it quicker and easier if you have trouble with your less dominant hand. Oh, and I do find that adding a little extra touch with your own polishes compliments the nails nicely (small strokes, matte coat, whatever you like), but only if you feel confident enough to.",

So, fake nails are a comfort for me because I can't just bite them off and make them look are jacked and sad like my real nails. For people with the same problem, I am really going to recommend this product because they are easy to put on and inexpensive at around 6.69. The product is Kiss Everlasting French Nails and I received it complimentary for testing purposes in my Spring Vox Box from Influentser. You start the process by removing all nail polish and oil from your nails. Then you go in with the manicure stick included and push back your cuticles. You are supposed to trim your nails as well, but since I chew mine down so much I was able to skip this step. Next, you pick out the sizes you are going to use for each finger. You can trim the sides a bit with the nail file if needed. Then you hold the nails by the tab and apply the glue. You also add a little glue to your natural nail. Then you apply the nail slowly and hold until it sticks. Wipe the excess glue. Then just bend the tab and twist to remove it. After that you just apply a top coat and you are all done. :) You have adorable little nails. A couple things I will say though. First, these nails aren't intended to last longer than 10 days. I'm sure they can, but they aren't made to. Also, mine ended up a bit crooked to really make sure you're getting them on straight.",

It is very hard to type and do other things especially with my kids with long nails when you are not used to them. Next day I did trim down. Like them better like this. Tip though check first so that you can trim from the top so you still have the nice french color more! Days later: I have popped them all off. They came off slowly one by one. I would say for a special occasion or night out these are great. More than 1-2 weeks is pushing it. Still they held up and didn't chip/break.

Since I didn't have the removing solution for these nails and ended up using acetone as recommended on the box and they took forever to come off and I really soaked them.

The application process was super simple, but be careful to not put too much glue on because if it squeeze from under the nails it gets a bit sticky on your other fingers.

It took me about 10 minutes total to figure out which nails to use and to glue them on. They immediately dried and then I had a fresh manicure with no hassle. In two days the nails started to pop off, which did not surprise me. At least these nails don't hurt when they come off, unlike real acrylics. Overall the nails looked really good at a glance and in pictures, but not so great up close. I probably would purchase these if I needed a quick and cheap manicure. *I received this product complimentary for testing purposes*",

So, I use these types of nails. I was so happy when I received the short length because I prefer shorter nails. These have a flexibility about them that allow them to move yet stay on your nails great. They lasted on me for about 4 days, but only because I'm rough with my nails ie. washing dishes, cleaning, ect. I think that if I were to use the heavy duty super glue for nails these would have lasted a lot longer and I plan on picking up a second pair to test this out and see. I think they look realistic - people thought I had gotten my nails done, but I explained I had gotten these to test out and where id gotten them from. I'm overall really impressed!",

The application process took me about 10 mins and on the back of the package there was easy to read instructions. There are so many nails in this kit so if any of them fall off you have plenty of replacement nails. I really like how this kit came with every thing needed. Glue, nails, nail file, and cuticle stick. Makes doing your nails easy. Another plus is that they last 7 days with no chipping, salon nails for a affordable price. I did have one problem while applying the first 2 nails, i put a bit too much glue and you could see the glue under the nail. But overall for my fist time applying fake nails i did a great job, practice makes perfect. I really like how long these lasted i got to day 6 when one nail fell off and i did so much chores and cleaning so glad with the results.",

I normally prefer my nails to be a little longer than this, but I was pleasantly surprised at how nice they looked once they all were on! They glue was fantastic at making them stick almost immediately - and the little tab helped so that I didn't accidentally get glue all over the fronts of the nails. My biggest issue - which not everyone will have - is that my nail beds are incredibly flat. Normally when picking out false nails, I need to go with the ones that are specifically made for flat beds. Since these are quite rounded, they do pop off my nails more easily, just because there's not as much nail actually attached directly to my real nail. Still, I just carry a thing of glue in my purse and glue it right back on - no harm done! :) I'm loving these nails!",

From an arms length away they do look pretty fabulous and I will be using them again in the future.",

As I mentioned before, since I'm a working-stay-at-home mom, sometimes I don't get time in the day to brush my hair let alone spend time doing my nails. So the fact that I got this in my Spring Fling VoxBox was super convenient. This product is awesome because it has all the tools you would need and only takes about five minutes to apply. I am a tall woman so I have big hands, and these nails make my hands look good. Pros: 1. Easy and fast to apply 2. Looks Classy- makes the ordinary of tasks look good 3. Short Nails- doesn't get in the way of the day to day life activities 5. Affordable- saving about 75 of what you would be paying if you went to the Salon Cons: 1. I have nothing to complain about other than the nails come off, but it comes with the territory. I spend about 6 hours typing and I'm changing diapers, moving furniture, cooking, cleaning...so what can I expect The good thing though is that they come with extra nails to replace the ones that come off. To review this product in a nutshell: The Kiss Everlasting French Nail Manicure set is affordable, easy to apply and makes my nails look like I went and got it done in a Salon, without having to pay Salon prices. Very satisfied and more than likely will purchase **I received these products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster**",

Since they are too short I can't really speak to how long they last on either unfortunately.

The length is slightly longer than I would normally keep my natural nails at, but I like how they make my hands look! Thank you, Influenster for allowing me the privilege of receiving and reviewing these nails, as this is not normally something I would even consider. Now, I will happily go out and buy these again based on the ease of application and how they make me feel!",

I like to change my nail color and style often so it can get pricey. These nails are so easy to apply just follow the simple instruction and you're set! These nails are also the perfect size for me. I often feel like really long nails can get in the way of daily duties but these are amazing. They also come with a wide variety of sizes to fit your nails. Overall, definitely recommend. :) PS.

I love how quick and easy they were to put on. The length is perfect for an active individual, like myself, so they don't get in the way of typing, crafting, or any other activity. All total they only took me about 10 minutes from nail clipping to dry to put on. The longest part being picking out which nail I needed for which nail on my hand to make sure I had a perfect fit. They look beautiful and natural on and feel great! I would highly recommend this product and would definitely use it again.",

I love French manicures, but can never get them perfect enough when I do them myself with nail polish. This kind didn't chip or fall off, they lasted for over a week and then I just took them off myself. I highly recommend these! You can't beat such high quality for such a reasonable price!

I'm also very happy that I found the perfect size to fit each nail. I normally have an issue with not finding quite the right size especially for my wider thumbs, but the largest nail in this kit was even too large for me so there are plenty of size options (14 for each hand.) Overall, I really enjoy this product. They feel strong, they're not too long, and I think they look very professional and classy. Would definitely re purchase.",

They have handy little tabs on the end that you use to apply the nail, and then you break them off and file down the tip a bit after the glue dries. Super easy, and I'm pleased with the results. Do my hands look tanner now The fit was nice, and the nails are advertised as chip free. I'm interested to see how they wear, but they seem well made and sturdy.

Kiss brand false nails are most definitely my favorite and the ones I always gravitate toward. I've used other brands, but these ones fit me the best and last the longest.

You have so many choices to chose from, but French is always the easiest and goes with any outfit. I for one don't do white french, I have a colorful personality, punk rock and edgy, I always do black french. My mother had the above emergency and had no time to get her nails professionally done. I remembered that Influenster Kiss sent the everlasting French set to me in my voxbox, sized her nails to a perfect fit, glue (which is provided) and applied. She was ready in just a few minutes. The great thing about the nails is that they have Flex-Fit Technology to ensure comfort and a perfect fit. These nails looked professionally done. My mom went out and had a great night, the next morning her nails were all still intact. They didn't move! Throughout the rest of the day, they glue started to wear thin and they popped off but that's okay get a better and stronger glue and reapply!

My only disappointment is that some of the glue patterns can be seen up-close through the sheer piece of the nail. I may try painting them in the future!",

I am not usually one to get my nails done however, since they were free, I figured why not try them out I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of these nails. Since there are so many different sizes in the package, it was easy to find nails that fit my hands perfectly. When I was putting these nails on, I didn't use enough glue, so they fell off within 48 hours. But, with a little more glue, I'm sure they would last a little longer. I can definitely see myself using these for a special occasion or a night out in the future.",

I received Kiss Everlasting French Nails complimentary for testing purposes a couple of days ago and I decided to give them a try. I was really very impressed with the result. In the package, you will get 28 nails in different sizes to make it easier to find the correct nail your fingers. You also get a small emery board, a tube of nail glue, and a cuticle stick. One thing I loved about this set in comparison to other brands Ive tried in the past is the fact that the white tip is fused into the nail and not airbrushed on. This is perfect if you want to buff the shine off of the nails or you may want to experiment with color and remove it later with nail polish remover. The white tip will not fade or chip and I will recommend that you clean your nails with acetone or buff them before you apply the glue so it can stick better. Cover the nail entirely with a good amount of glue because if you don't air bubbles will be visible underneath the nail and it won't look natural. The box stated that the nails lasted for 7 days and mine last about that long. I would definitely recommend this nail kit to anyone looking to switch up their nail length or someone in a hurry and doesnt have time for a manicure. It did the job it was supposed to do and I was very satisfied with my nails.",

They were very easy to get used to once I applied them. The glue was not that easy and making a mess by applying to much was simple. But, once I did a few, the rest came out much better. In terms of longevity, they say you should remove them at 7 days. But I'm not sure I'll have any left on by then. I lost 2 on day 4 and reglued the first one that fell off before giving up once a second did. I thought that I was being careful with them to make them last the 7 days, but it just didn't work out. I've since loosened the edges of the remaining nails in hopes that I don't need the fancy remover. And so far they have been coming off on their own. Therefore, I think they would be perfect for a special occasion since so many people commented that they looked really nice and natural. But I don't think I would chose to apply them every week. For regular days, I'll stick to my real nails.",

The nail tabs make the nails easy to apply and the tabs tear off quite easily. The included emery board works well at rounding out the edges if necessary.

I did have to lightly file the tip where the tab was but it didn't not change the look. They lasted about a week and a hlaf for me and that was with daily hand washing dishes and playing with two babies under the age of 3. And, also a dip in the pool did not loosen the nails.

The price is very low, which is great because many products in this range do not work at all - that said, these definitely reach expectations, surpass them even. Next best thing to salon acrylics. Many nails on the market, and even past Kiss products, would come right off in hot water (at least in my experience) but with this set, I actually had to use scalding water, acetone, and nail clippers to remove them. Of course this probably had to do with the fact that they were applied just an hour prior, but there is no denying that that type of quality is often expected. These nails would be great for anyone at any experience level, since they come with loads of tips on how to complete the manicure.",

The kit has a wide variety of sizes, 14, that will accommodate all size fingernails. The process is easy, start with a clean nail, apply glue to artificial and natural nail, press on for 5 seconds and you're done! The package states to leave on for no more than a week and that's about how long the glue will last. I use my hands a lot so I expect one or two to pop off. There were enough nails in the kit to provide 2+ full sets so I had my French manicure for a good three weeks. If I were to pay the 5 retail, it would be well worth it. 1/week for a French manicure That's a fantastic deal and I got tons of compliments on the nails.",

On Satrurday morning, I decided to give myself a manicure for my friends Engagement party that night and a manicure that would look great for the whole upcoming work week. The Kiss Everlasting French Nails in Real Short Length that I received from Influenster was the first product I thought of so I read the directions and in less then 10 minutes I had these BEAUTIFUL nails that looked like a Gel French Manicure you would pay upward of 45.00 for at a nail salon! They were quick and simple to apply and last for up to a week! There are 28 nail covers in 14 sizes! This was a perfect neutral manicure that Influenster provided me with because it would match whatever I would wear to work in the upcoming work week and I had BEAUTIFUL nails for the Engagement Party Saturday night. I am in LOVE with my everlasting french manicure. They DID NOT CHIP AT ALL I wore them all week to work, did dishes and other household chores with NO CHIPPING or LOSING A NAIL!",

The Kiss Nails came in an easy to open black and red box. Very glad it came with a full set of nails plus extras, that was a plus. Came with a gel glue which went on my nails and did't run. It was very easy to match my nails with the numbers to get a good fit. It also came with a small black/pink nail file and cuticle pusher. Overall the process took no more than 15 minutes. Noticed the glue dried quickly and was a super hold on the nails. Looked like I just got them done from the salon. The only thing is that my skin is dark so the nail color really didn't match. They did hold up for about two weeks, with the everyday use of mommy chores. I would recommend these if you need something quick for any event and want to save some money.",

About day 3, a couple of them came off, but I just got the glue out and reapplied and you can't tell they were reaffixed. For the price approx. 5 you could do this 2x a week and it would still be cheaper than going to the salon 2x a month for fake nails. I am definitely a new customer.

No waiting to dry your nails, you literally glue and go! The glue is gentle to your natural nail bed but strong enough to hold the nail in place. No one wants a flying nail no matter how gorgeous they may look, but with Kiss Everlasting French, you are free of nail attacks. I love the peachy pink colored base that has a nice tone that matches any skin color beautifully. The white tip has a pleasant hue but not so white that it looks unpleasant or too intense. The box supplies you enough nails to get 2 applications and for the cost of under 6.50, you can get a salon look without the price tag.

Be aware that the nails were intended for only 7 day wear after that they come off pretty quickly. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",

It is a pack of 28 so you got enough to do this two times. The file they included is great and can file down the strongest of nails.At first they feel as little heavy and tight on the nail but if you are used to acrylic nails then the tightness is nothing new and fade over time. The real short nail length are great length for those who use their hands all day. They look real and you will receive compliments all day..the best thing about them! The glue they include is not that strong so I would recommend that you buy a separate stronger one.",

The color is excellent and the white stayed white even after days of wear and that included washing dishes and doing everyday work. I believe I will try these again myself. I love the way they look and as cheap and easy as they are who wouldnt give them a try I will say use of minimal glue is fine as long as you press them on flat.Extra glue will seep from the sides and you dont want that. I figured that out after the first 2. All in all a great product.",

However, I was pleasantly surprised by these nails! The application process was by far the easier I have ever experienced, and the overall look of the finished product was AMAZING! As a lifetime nail biter, I have poured a lot of money into expensive salon manicures, but I can say that these nails are just as high quality as what I get from the salon.

The application process is simple - clean nails, apply provided glue to both natural nail and fake nail, press together and BAM! you're done. The little break away tabs make application a breeze. They claim to last 7 days, which I found to be conservative - I only had 1 come off, but I saved it and just re-glued it when I got home. Removal was equally easy - just file top layer and tip, soak in polish remover, and peel off. It comes with 28 different nails 2 in each size (14 sizes) so that you can find the perfect fit. I also painted over them with a nail art design to customize them a little. Highly recommend, you wont regret getting these!",

They were a bit short for me because I like to keep my nails pretty long, but it was nice how they didn't snag on anything or look like claws. I was a little bit disappointed that three of them have already come off and I've only had them on two days, but I don't think it's the nails fault or the glue. I constantly have my hands in water doing dishes or laundry, so it's probably just me not being cautious enough. Overall, I do like the product. This is the first time I've ever used fake nails or had any type of manicure, so these made me feel very girly and feminine.

These will be my go-to nails anytime I want a French manicure from now on! A couple of tips: More is not better when it comes to applying the nail glue! Too much glue will make the nails come off sooner than if you just use a small amount. File and/or cut the nails to size if they're too large to help keep them on longer. I have very small fingers so even the smallest size of any brand is often too large for me, especially my pinky. When I filed and cut them to fit better, they lasted much longer! You can actually get more uses out of one box by cutting down the largest nails if they're too big for you.",
