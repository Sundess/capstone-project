Some people don't really care but I think it's a little icky. Carmine is also has other names, can't recall exactly, like Red 4 and some others. This information is easy to find. I think it's interesting that all of the fruit oils are given their pleasant names however carmine does not say beetle dye in parentheses next to the ingredient name. When I wore this lip shimmer prior to gaining this knowledge, I did enjoy the colors and the conditioning properties. Burt's Bees is a good company, but not as perfect as everyone believes.

As I mentioned, I see no justification whatsoever why, especially a company with the status and name such as yours, would do away with such a color that is so very difficult to locate at any level, whether it be from the local pharmacy, to the high end department store cosmetic counters. True browns are VERY difficult to find. PLEASE bring it back. On my last purchase, I bought every tube the store had, which was 12. I did not know at this time the color had even been discontinued.
